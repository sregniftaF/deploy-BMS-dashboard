# IoT Dashboard for Battery Management System
The IoT Dashboard is a crucial component of the Battery Management System (BMS), providing stakeholders with a user-friendly interface to monitor battery performance. It is a responsive dashboard that displays all current battery readings from the BMS such as voltage, current and temperature.

The Dashboard application follows a client-server architecture:
- **Client-side**: The user interface, accessible through web browsers or mobile devices, displays the battery data fetched from the Cloud and uses dynamic HTML to generate the script.
- **Server-side**: The Cloud server hosts the data collected from the BMS and provides a HTTP API endpoint to retrieve the data.
