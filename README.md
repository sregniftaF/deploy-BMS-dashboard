# IoT Dashboard for Battery Management System
The IoT Dashboard is a crucial component of the Battery Management System (BMS), providing stakeholders with a user-friendly interface to monitor battery performance. It is a responsive dashboard that displays all current battery readings from the BMS such as voltage, current and temperature.

The Dashboard application follows a client-server architecture:
- **Client-side**: The user interface, accessible through web browsers or mobile devices, displays the battery data fetched from the Cloud and uses dynamic HTML to generate the script.
- **Server-side**: The Cloud server hosts the data collected from the BMS and provides a HTTP API endpoint to retrieve the data.


# Features
Status | Feature | Description
--- | --- | ---
done | Voltage output | Displays voltage output across the battery pack in Volts (V)
done | Current output | Displays amount of current flowing through the BMS circuit in Ampere (A)
done | Temperature output | Displays current average temperature reading from all 8 battery cells in Degrees Celcius (Â°C)
done | Cell readings | Displays current parameters of each cell
done | Notification | Shows important messages to be noted by the user, e.g. overheating of battery cell
done | Responsive page design | Allows the same website URL to be used on tablet, desktop or mobile devices with an eye-pleasing and intuitive dashboard interface
done | Light/Dark mode | Customise dashboard appearance between day/night modes to reduce strain on user's eyes depending on the surrounding environment
